# List of Created Components

This page is the documentation for the custom components created for this project. Each component has a description of its purpose, a list of its props (if there's any), and a how-to-use section.
**If new components are created, they should be added to this list in alphabetical order.**

## Icons

This component contains a limited list of svg icons that are manually copied and pasted from online sources. The icons are stored in the `icons` folder and its code are imported into the `index.js` file and exported as a single component. The icons are used in the `Icon` component.

### How to Use

```mdx
import { Icon } from 'components/icons'

<Icon.box /> Download .zip
```

### How to Add New Icons

1. Find and download an svg icon online. Make sure it's free to use and similar to the other icons in the list.
2. Place the svg icon in the `icons` component folder.
3. Open the svg file and copy its code.
4. Add a new property inside `Icons` with the name of the icon, and set its value to an anonymous function that returns the svg code as a JSX element (paste it inside the parentheses).

**Example:**

```tsx
export const Icons = {
  ...
  box: () => (
    <svg
      xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
      fill="none"
      viewBox="0 0 24 24"
      stroke-width="1.5"
      stroke="currentColor"
    >
      <path
        stroke-linecap="round"
        stroke-linejoin="round"
        d="M21 7.5l-9-5.25L3 7.5m18 ..."
      />
    </svg>
  ),
  ...
}
```

## IFrame

This component is used to display an `<iframe>{:jsx}` element which is useful if you want to embed a video or any other external content. This is mostly used in the [Youtube Videos](/getting-started/primer/videos) page.

### How to Use

```mdx
import { IFrame } from 'components/iframe'

<IFrame src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/..." />
```

## Members

This component is used to display a list of members. It's used in the [Team](/team#current-members) page. It also has <TL>TL</TL> and <Member>Member</Member> components that are used to display color-coded text.

### How to Use

```mdx
import Members, { TL, Member } from 'components/members'

<Members current={true} />
<TL> team leader </TL>
<Member> member </Member>
```

### Props

<OptionTable
  options={[
    ['current', 'boolean', 'Displays current or past (false) members working in the project'],
  ]}
/>

### For TL and PM

To add a new member, you need to add a new object to the `members` array in the `members.json` file. The object should have the following properties:

- `name` - The name of the member.
- `isTeamLead` - A boolean value that indicates if the member is a team lead.
- `isCurrentMember` - A boolean value that indicates if the member is a current member or a past member.
- `roles` - An object that contains the roles of the member. The keys are the roles and the values are boolean values that indicate if the member has that role or not.
- `programmingLanguages` - An array of strings that contains the programming languages that the member knows.
- `frameworksAndLibraries` - An array of strings that contains the frameworks and libraries that the member knows.
- `tools` - An array of strings that contains the tools that the member knows.

For example:

```json copy
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "isTeamLead": true,
  "isCurrentMember": false,
  "roles": {
    "UI/UX": true,
    "Front-end": true,
    "Back-end": false
  },
  "programmingLanguages": ["HTML", "CSS", "SCSS", "JavaScript", "Python", "C++"],
