# Managing NewsMead Docs

This article shows how to manage this documentation site and how to contribute to it.
This documentation site is built using Nextra, a Markdown-based content builder for Next.js.

## Prerequisites

All you need to learn is in the [Nextra documentation](https://nextra.site/docs/guide). Here is the cheat sheet of [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet#basic-syntax) that you can use.

## Coding Conventions

### Frontmatter

The front matter is the metadata of the page and it is **always required** (except home page). It is written in YAML format and is enclosed in `---` at the top of the page. For example:

```mdx
---
title: How to Document
description: This is a guide on how to document.
---

import { Callout } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

...
```

### Naming

The following are the naming conventions used in this documentation site:

1. All files and folders are in `kebab-case` which are in lowercase and uses hyphens to separate words. For example, `how-to-document.md` instead of `HowToDocument.md` or `how_to_document.md`.
2. As much as possible, limit the name of the file to 1-3 words. For example, `how-to-document.md` instead of `how-to-document-in-this-site.md`. You can modify the title in `_meta.json` to make it more descriptive.

## File and Folder Structure

The following file and folder structure is a presentation on how to organize the documentation site:

<FileTree>
  {/* components folder */}
  <FileTree.Folder name="components" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="<component name>" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="index.tsx" />
      <FileTree.File name="style.module.tsx (optional)" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
  {/* pages folder */}
  <FileTree.Folder name="pages" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name="_meta.json" />
    <FileTree.File name="index.mdx" />
    <FileTree.File name="<pageA>.mdx" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="<pageA>" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="_meta.json" />
      <FileTree.File name="<page>.mdx" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
  {/* public folder */}
  <FileTree.Folder name="public" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name="newsmead-docs.png" />
    <FileTree.File name="og.png" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="images" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="example-image-here.png" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

### Pages Folder

The [Nextra Documentation](https://nextra.site/docs/docs-theme/page-configuration#pages) shows you **the complete guide** on how to configure the pages of the documentation site.

In summary:

- The `pages` folder contains all the pages of the documentation site.
- The `index.mdx` file is the home page of the documentation site.
- The `_meta.json` file contains the metadata and configuration of the documentation site.
- The `<page>.mdx` files and the like, are the pages of the documentation site. Depending on their setting in `_meta.json`, they can be in the sidebar or navbar. Keep in mind the [naming conventions](#naming) when creating a page file.
- The `<pageA>` folder contains the subpages or documentation that are grouped together. You can make the `<pageA>` folder a visitable page by adding the `<pageA>.mdx` file beside it, otherwise it just adds a dropdown on it in the sidebar. In the file and folder structure above, the `<pageA>` folder is visitable.

### Public Folder

The `public` folder contains all the assets of the documentation site.
Keep in mind the [naming conventions](#naming) as well as the following when adding assets:

- Any asset files that are for the site (such as logos like `alt-tutors-docs.png`) are placed in `publics` folder.
- Any images used for tutorials, screenshots, etc. are placed in the `images` folder.
- Any videos used for tutorials, demos, etc. are placed in the `videos` folder.

### Components Folder

Most components used are built-ins which you can check in the [Nextra Documentation](https://nextra.site/docs/guide/built-ins).
The custom components created and used in this documentation site can be found in [Custom Components](/custom-components) page.

In this file and folder structure:

- The `components` folder contains all the custom components used in the documentation site.
- The `<component name>` folder contains the component files. Keep in mind the [naming conventions](#naming) when creating a component folder.
- The `index.tsx` file is the component file. You can copy the starter code:

```tsx copy
import styles from './style.module.css'

export function ComponentName() {
  return <div className={styles.container}>...do something here...</div>
}
```

- The `style.module.tsx` file is the component style file and is optional if you plan to style it with [Nextra's Tailwind CSS](#styling-with-nextras-tailwind-css).
  You can style like this:

```tsx
.container {
  ...add styles here...
}
```

#### Importing custom components

To import a custom component, you can use the following syntax if there is no `default{:jsx}` export:

```tsx
// component with no default export
export function ComponentName() {
  return <div>...do something here...</div>
}

// import
import { ComponentName } from 'components/<component name>'
```

otherwise you can use the following syntax:

```tsx /default/
// component with default export
export default function ComponentName() {
  return <div>...do something here...</div>
}

// import
import ComponentName from 'components/<component name>'
```

#### Styling with Nextra's Tailwind CSS

Unfortunately, Tailwind CSS isn't working in this documentation site.
You can use Nextra's Tailwind CSS which is still Tailwind CSS but with limited class names.
You can check the `node_modules/nextra-theme-docs/style.css` file and [unminify](https://mrcoles.com/blog/css-unminify/) it to see properly the available class names.

To style a component with Nextra's Tailwind CSS, just use Tailwind CSS syntax with `nx-` prefix. For example:

```tsx
<p className="nx-mt-10">This is a paragraph with a margin top of 2.5rem.</p>
```

If it doesn't work, it means that that class name doesn't exist in the `style.css` file.
Alternatively, you can create and use `style.module.css` file.

For colors, you can check the `.dark` and `.light` classes in the `style.css` file. The color variables usually start with `--shiki-` prefix.
